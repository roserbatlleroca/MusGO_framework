  notes:

# [1] Open Source Code
sourcecode:
  class: open
  link: https://github.com/Stability-AI/stable-audio-tools
  notes: Code for data processing, training pipeline, and inference is available in the stable-audio-tools repository. Architecture of the mode is specified in the form of a config file.

# [2] Training data
trainingdata:
  class: open
  link: https://info.stability.ai/attributions
  notes: Training data can be mapped from Attribution files. Dataset attribution files can also be accessed in HuggingFace after accepting Stability AI conditions (https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-audio-open-1.0/blob/main/fma_dataset_attribution2.csv and https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-audio-open-1.0/blob/main/freesound_dataset_attribution2.csv).

# [3] Model weights
modelweights:
  class: open
  link: https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-audio-open-1.0/tree/main
  notes: Weights are available in the HuggingFace repository. However, accessibility is subject to accepting Stability AI conditions. 

# [4] Code documentation
codedoc:
  class: open
  link: https://github.com/Stability-AI/stable-audio-tools/blob/main/README.md
  notes: Documentation of the code is limited for training replicating the model. Although there are not specific config files for Stable Audio Open, those from Stable Audio could be used.
