# [1] Open Source Code
sourcecode:
  class: open
  link: https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-audio-open-1.0
  notes: " Code for data processing, training pipeline, and inference is available
    in the stable-audio-tools repository. Architecture of the mode is specified in
    the form of a config file.\nhttps://github.com/Stability-AI/stable-audio-tools"

# [2] Training data
trainingdata:
  class: open
  link: ''
  notes: 'Training data can be mapped from Attribution files.https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-audio-open-1.0/blob/main/fma_dataset_attribution2.csv.
    However, accessibility is subject to accepting Stability AI conditions. '

# [3] Model weights
modelweights:
  class: open
  link: ''
  notes: 'Weights are available at: https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-audio-open-1.0.
    However, accessibility is subject to accepting Stability AI conditions. '

# [4] Code documentation
codedoc:
  class: open
  link: ''
  notes: "Documentation of the code is limited for training replicating the model
    (not specific config files, but those from Stable Audio could be used). However,
    I think we can still consider the documentation of the code to be enough.\nhttps://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-audio-open-1.0https://github.com/Stability-AI/stable-audio-tools"

# [5] Training procedure
trainprocedure:
  class: open
  link: http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14358
  notes: 'Described in pre-print. Warning: They say they provide the exact parameters
    for training in the repository, but I can’t find them. '

# [6] Evaluation procedure
evalprocedure:
  class: open
  link: http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14358

# [7] Research paper
paper:
  class: partial

# [9] Model Card
modelcard:
  class: star
  link: ''
  notes: 'Model card in HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-audio-open-1.0'

# [10] Datasheet
datasheet:
  class: ∅
  link: ''
  notes: 'They provide a .csv file listing each wav from Freesound and FMA. But there
    is no proper datasheet. It’s a pity they don’t get this start because they are
    careful about the data they use.    '

# [11] Package
package:
  class: star
  link: ''
  notes: 'The model can be used with: 1. the https://github.com/Stability-AI/stable-audio-tools
    library and 2. the https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/index library'

# [12] User-oriented application
ux:
  class: ∅
  link: ''
  notes: I can’t find an official user-oriented application apart from the packages
    and code examples. But I am sure that the community around the model is building
    this kind of resource. We should check.
