# [1] System source code
sourcecode:
    class: open
    link: https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/YuE
    notes: Source code is available in the GitHub repo, including inference code and model architecture. They also provide instructions on how to fine-tune YuE for specific data (see https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/YuE/tree/main/finetune), including data processing and training procedure. 

# [2] Training data
trainingdata:
    class: closed
    link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08638
    notes: Speech-related datasets are introduced (i.e., WeNetSpeech (zh), LibriHeavy (en), and GigaSpeech (en)). But for music, they only indicate that they rely on 650K hours of music recordings. No information on specific data sources, acquisition methods, and data licensing is given. See "Data Setup" in Section 5.1. of the technical report. 

# [3] Model weights

    notes: Checkpoints are avialble in Hugging Face. 

# [4] Code documentation 
codedoc:
    class: open 
    link: https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/YuE
    notes: Codebase is documented in the GitHub repository, including installation requirements and usage instructions.

# [5] Training procedure
trainprocedure:
    class: open
    link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08638
    notes: Training procedure is properly described, including hardware requirements and confirgurations (see Section 4 and Section 5.1).

# [6] Evaluation procedure
evalprocedure:
    class: open
    link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08638
    notes: Evaluation procedure is described in Section 5.2 of the technical report, including both objective and subjective evaluation methods. Evaluation metrics implementations are referenced in the text.
