    notes:

# [1] System source code
sourcecode:
    class: open
    link: https://github.com/acids-ircam/AFTER
    notes: Source code is available in the GitHub repository, including data processing, training and inference pipelines, as well as model architecture.

# [2] Training data
trainingdata:
    class: partial
    link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00196
    notes: Datasets used for training the original model (SLAKH, MaestroV2, GuitarSet and URMP) are publicly available and described in the paper, but the datasets used for training the current model are unknown.

# [3] Model weights
modelweights:
    class: open
    link: https://nubo.ircam.fr/index.php/s/8NFD5gWwbkT4G5P
    notes: Weights are available to download from the link provided in the GitHub repository.

# [4] Code documentation 
codedoc:
    class: open
    link: https://github.com/acids-ircam/AFTER/blob/main/README.md
    notes: Documentation is available in the GitHub repository, including installation requirements, examples of scripts usage and configuration files. The codebase could still benefit from more detailed documentation.

# [5] Training procedure
trainprocedure:
    class: partial
    link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00196
    notes: Training procedure of the original model is fully described in the paper, but relevant changes in the model architecture and training procedure are not properly documented.

# [6] Evaluation procedure
evalprocedure:
    class: partial
    link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00196
    notes: Evaluation procedure of the original model is fully described in the paper, including used metrics and implementation details. However, no evaluation is provided for the current model.

# [7] Research paper
paper:
    class: partial
    link: https://zenodo.org/records/14877437
    notes: Original paper is publicly available and peer-reviewed, but no publication is available for the current model.
