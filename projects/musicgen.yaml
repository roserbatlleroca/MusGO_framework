  notes: “We rely on an internal dataset of 10K high-quality music tracks, and on
    the ShutterStock and Pond5 music data collections2 with respectively 25K and 365K
    instrument-only music tracks.” “Note that we do NOT provide any of the datasets
    used for training MusicGen. We provide a dummy dataset containing just a few examples
    for illustrative purposes.”
