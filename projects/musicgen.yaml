# [1] Open Source Code
sourcecode:
  class: open
  link: https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft
  notes: Code is available. 

# [2] Training data
trainingdata:
  class: partial
  link: 
  notes: They describe the datasets used to training their model (licensed data). However, they rely on 10k music tracks that are not described
    (proprietary data). They do not provide any of the datasets used for training MusicGen. Only a dummy dataset containing just a few examples
    for illustrative purposes is provided.

# [3] Model weights
modelweights:
  class: open
  link: https://huggingface.co/facebook/musicgen-large/tree/main
  notes: Models are available in the GitHub repository and in Hugging Face.

# [4] Code documentation
codedoc:
  class: open
  link: https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft/blob/main/docs/MUSICGEN.md
  notes: Codebase is documented in the GitHub repository, including installation requirements. 

# [5] Training procedure
trainprocedure:
  class: open
  link: https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft/blob/main/docs/TRAINING.md
  notes: Training is well documented, with training pipelines and environment setup described. 
    Note that hardware use for training is described in the paper. 

# [6] Evaluation procedure
evalprocedure:
  class: open
  link: https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft/blob/main/docs/METRICS.md.
  notes: Evaluation is documented in the paper and the code provides detailed explanation about the implementation of evaluation metrics. 
   Evaluating the model to reproduce the results still may require some effort. Dataset used for evaluation is MusicCaps benchmark.
