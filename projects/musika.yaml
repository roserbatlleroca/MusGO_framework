# [1] Open Source Code
sourcecode:
  class: open
  link: https://github.com/marcoppasini/musika
  notes: Codebase is available and complete. 

# [2] Training data
trainingdata:
  class: partial
  link: 
  notes: Training data is described in the research paper. Some of the data used
    is publicly available (LibriTTS corpus). However, there are some sections of the
    used data that are not accessible or detailed enough to fully reconstruct the
    dataset (South by SouthWest). Also, music coming from http://jamendo.com under
    “techno” genre is not detailed.
