# [1] Open Source Code
sourcecode:
  class: open
  link: https://github.com/openai/jukebox
  notes: Code is available at GitHub repository. The codebase is not actively maintained
    anymore, but it is still available for use. It includes the model architecture, training
    and evaluation code, and utilities for generating music samples.

# [2] Training data
trainingdata:
  class: partial
  link: 
  notes: Training data is partially described in the preprint article. However, relevant
    information is missing, such as specific sources, and data itself cannot be accessed
    — dataset is not publicly available. 

# [3] Model weights
modelweights:
  class: open
  link: https://huggingface.co/openai/jukebox-5b-lyrics/tree/main
  notes: Weights are available.

# [4] Code documentation
codedoc:
  class: open
  link: https://github.com/openai/jukebox/blob/master/README.md
  notes: Codebase is documented. 

# [5] Training procedure
trainprocedure:
  class: open
  link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00341
  notes: Information available between article and GitHub repository.  

# [6] Evaluation procedure
evalprocedure:
  class: partial
  link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00341
  notes: Part of the evaluation procedure is documented in the research paper. However, key information is missing, 
    such as the evaluation dataset, objective evaluation metrics and details on the manual evaluation.
