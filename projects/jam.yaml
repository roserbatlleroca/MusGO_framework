    notes:

# [1] System source code
sourcecode:
    class: open
    link: https://github.com/declare-lab/jamify
    notes: Source code is available in the GitHub repository, including data processing, training and inference code, as well as model architecture. 

# [2] Training data
trainingdata:
    class: closed
    link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20880
    notes: Training data is not available nor properly described. In the research paper, they only indicate that they rely on a ~1 million song dataset, resulting into ~54k hours of audion. No information on specific data sources, acquisition methods, and data licensing is given. See "Dataset Setup" in Section 4.1. of the pre-print.

# [3] Model weights
modelweights:
    class: open
    link: https://huggingface.co/declare-lab/JAM-0.5/blob/main/jam-0_5.safetensors
    notes: Pre-trained version of the model is available in Hugging Face.

# [4] Code documentation 
codedoc:
    class: open
    link: https://github.com/declare-lab/jamify/blob/main/README.md
    notes: Codebase is documented, including high-level instructions and configuration files.

# [5] Training procedure
trainprocedure:
    class: open
    link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20880
    notes: Training procedure is properly described, including hardware requirements and confirgurations (see Section 4.2).

# [6] Evaluation procedure
evalprocedure:
    class: open
    link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20880
    notes: "The evaluation procedure is properly described, including evaluation data, metrics, and implementation details (see Section 4.3). With the aim to standarize evaluation across models, they propose JAME: a genre-driverse evaluation dataset for full-track generation. This dataset is publicly available in Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/datasets/declare-lab/JAME)." 
    
# [7] Research paper
paper:
    class: partial
    link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20880
    notes: Pre-print is available. No peer-reviewed version of the article has been found.
