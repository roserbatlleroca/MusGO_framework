	<p class="highlight" id="description"> With the notable rise of generative models in the music domain, we pose the question: how open are they?
    Lacking of a clear definition of openness in music-generative AI, we propose <strong>MusGO</strong> (Music-Generative Open AI): a community-driven framework for assessing openness in music-generative AI.
  MusGO is built together with the participation of the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) and applied to assess openness in music-generative models.

	<h2>Openness assessment</h2>
  <p id="table-guide"> <em>How to interpret this table?</em> MusGO framework consists of 13 dimensions of openness, distinguishing between <em>essential</em> (1-8) and <em>desirable</em> (9-13) categories.  
Essential categories follow a three-level scale:  
(<span class="openness open"><strong>✔︎</strong> open</span>,  
<span class="openness partial"><strong>~</strong> partial</span>, or  
<span class="openness closed"><strong>✘</strong> closed</span>).  
Desirable categories are binary, indicating whether an element exists (⭐) or not.  

Models are ranked in descending order based on an <strong>openness score</strong> (O), which aggregates their openness across essential categories. The score is computed as follows: <strong>✔︎</strong> (open) counts as 1 point, <strong>~</strong> (partial) as 0.5 points, and <strong>✘</strong> (closed) as 0 points. Since three essential categories were rated as more relevant in the survey, they are weighted twice as much. The final score is normalized to a 100-point scale using the formula:  

O = ((E<sub>1</sub> + E<sub>2</sub> + E<sub>3</sub>) × 2 + (E<sub>4</sub> + E<sub>5</sub> + E<sub>6</sub> + E<sub>7</sub> + E<sub>8</sub>)) × (100 / 11).
