	<p class="highlight" id="description">Introducing <strong>MusGO</strong>: A community-driven framework for assessing openness in music-generative AI.
    With the notable rise of generative models in the music domain, we pose the question: how open are they? 
    MusGO is built and applied to assess openness in music-generative models. </p>
	
	<p id="tagline"> Note that this site is part of the submission <em>'MusGO: A Community-Driven Framework for Asssessing Openness in Music-Generative AI'</em> at ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT '25), which is currently under review.</p>
	
	<h3>Openness assessment</h3>
  <p id="table-guide"><em>How to interpret this table?</em> MusGO framework is composed of 13 different dimensions of openness. It distinguishes between <em>essential</em> (1-8) and <em>nice-to-have</em> (9-13) categories. 
    Essential categories follow a three-level scale: (<span class="openness open"><strong>✔︎</strong> open</span>, <span class="openness partial"><strong>~</strong> partial</span> or <span class="openness closed"><strong>✘</strong> closed</span>). <!-- with a direct link to the available evidence; on hover, the cell will display the notes we have on file for that judgement. The name of each project is a direct link to source data.-->
    Instead, nice-to-have categories are binary: whether that element exists (&#11088;) or not. The openness level is computed with the essential categories punctuations, where <strong>✔︎</strong> is 1, <strong>~</strong> is 0.5 and <strong>✘</strong> is 0 points. Openness level is normalised to obtained a value on a 100 point scale. 
    Models are arranged in descending order of openness level, placing the <strong>most open model</strong> first.</p>
