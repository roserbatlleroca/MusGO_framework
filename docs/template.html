<h1>MusGO Framework:</a> Assessing Openness in Music-Generative AI</h1>
</div>

<div id="content">

  <p class="highlight" id="description">
    The <strong>Music-Generative Open AI (MusGO)</strong> framework is a community-driven framework designed to assess the openness of music-generative models. 
    With a collaborative approach, it invites contributions from researchers and artists, supports public scrutiny, and enables tracking of model evolution to promote transparency, accountability, and responsible development.
  </p>

  <p>
This website builds on the paper <em>“MusGO: A Community-Driven Framework for Assessing Openness in Music-Generative AI”</em>, authored by Roser Batlle-Roca, Laura Ibáñez-Martínez, Xavier Serra, 
Emilia Gómez, and Martín Rocamora.  
It serves not only as a companion to the publication, but also as a living resource, which is continuously updated and shaped by contributions from the community.

  <h2>Openness Leaderdboard</h2>
  <div id="table-guide" class="highlight"><p>
    <em>How to interpret this table?</em> MusGO framework consists of 13 dimensions of openness, distinguishing between <em>essential</em> (1–8) and <em>desirable</em> (9–13) categories.  
    Essential categories follow a three-level scale:  
    (<span class="openness open"><strong>✔︎</strong> open</span>,  
    <span class="openness partial"><strong>~</strong> partial</span>, or  
    <span class="openness closed"><strong>✘</strong> closed</span>).  
    Desirable categories are binary, indicating whether an element exists (⭐) or not.  

  </p>
 <p>
    Models are ordered using a weighted
    openness score (O), based on essential categories (E) and
    normalised to a 100-point scale. Considering survey findings,
    the three most relevant categories (E<sub>1</sub>, E<sub>2</sub> and E<sub>3</sub>,
    all with M<sub>1,2,3</sub>=5) are weighted twice as much as the others.
    Note that the score is used for ordering purposes only,
    and we do not intend to reduce openness to a single value.
    When models achieve the same score, the order is determined
    by the highest number of fulfilled desirable categories.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each cell includes <strong>interactive elements</strong>: 
    <ul>
      <li>Hovering over a cell reveals a tooltip with the justification behind the assigned score.</li>
      <li>Clicking on a cell redirects you to the source of information or relevant supplementary material (e.g., research paper, source code, model checkpoints, etc.).</li>
    </ul>

    For a detailed brakedown of each model’s evaluation, you can explore its corresponding YAML file in the <a href="https://github.com/roserbatlleroca/MusGO_framework/tree/main/projects">project folder</a>.

<h3>Key Findings</h3> 

<ul>
  <li>The leaderboard reveals substantial variation in openness across music-generative models, with training procedure often most open, while training data remains the most closed.</li>
  <li>Models that share source code, model weights, and documentation typically also apply open or responsible licenses, indicating a correlation across these core categories.</li>
  <li>Desirable categories like datasheets are less frequently fulfilled, while supplementary material pages with demos are becoming a community norm.</li>
  <li>The leaderboard helps identify incomplete openness claims and potential ‘open-washing’, providing clear, evidence-based signals for transparency and accountability in the field.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In music, assessing training data openness is challenging due to IP constraints, and fully open status may rely on detailed documentation rather than direct data release.</li>
  <li>Hardware implications are underexplored: while some models can be trained on personal computers, others require heavy computational resources, affecting reproducibility and accessibility.</li>
  <li>The leaderboard does not capture ethical, societal, or creative impacts of these models, focusing strictly on openness dimensions. Yet, it does provide a foundation upon which these critical aspects can be integrated in future iterations.</li>
</ul>
