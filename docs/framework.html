            <p class="highlight" id="description"> We here describe with complete detail the <strong>Music-Generative Open AI (MusGO) framework</strong>: a community-driven framework for assessing openness in music-generative AI models.
                This detailed criteria is linked to the research article <em>“MusGO: A Community-Driven Framework for Assessing Openness in Music-Generative AI”</em>, authored by Roser Batlle-Roca, Laura Ibáñez-Martínez, Xavier Serra, 
Emilia Gómez, and Martín Rocamora.
            </p>

            MusGO framework consists of 13 dimensions of openness, distinguishing between <em>essential</em> (1–8) and <em>desirable</em> (9–13) categories.  
    Essential categories follow a three-level scale:  
    (<span class="openness open"><strong>✔︎</strong> open</span>,  
    <span class="openness partial"><strong>~</strong> partial</span>, or  
    <span class="openness closed"><strong>✘</strong> closed</span>).  
    Desirable categories are binary, indicating whether an element exists (⭐) or not.
