# MusGO Framework: Assessing Openness in Music-Generative AI 
❗ Note that this repository is part of the article 'MusGO: A Community-Driven Framework for Asssessing Openness in Music-Generative AI' submitted at ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT '25), which is currently under review.


## The MusGO framework

We introduce the **Music-Generative Open AI (MusGO)** framework, a community-driven framework built to assess openness in music-generative models. MusGO is composed of **13 categories**:

- **8 essential categories**:
1. *Open source code*  
2. *Training data*  
3. *Model weights*  
4. *Code documentation*  
5. *Training procedure*  
6. *Evaluation procedure*  
7. *Research paper*  
8. *Licensing*  
- **5 nice-to-have categories**:
9. *Model card*  
10. *Datasheet*  
11. *Package*  
12. *User-oriented application*  
13. *Supplementary material page*  

Essential categories follow an **openness-graded scale** of three levels:  
- **Closed** (🔴)  
- **Partial** (🟠)  
- **Fully open** (🟢)  

Nice-to-have categories are binary, indicating whether the element exists (**⭐**) or not.
