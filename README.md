The **Music-Generative Open AI (MusGO)** framework is a community-driven framework built to assess openness in music-generative models. With a collaborative approach, it invites contributions from researchers and artists, supports public scrutiny, and enables tracking of model evolution to promote transparency, accountability, and responsible development. Article _MusGO: A Community-Driven Framework For Assessing Openness in Music-Generative AI_ was accepted at the **26th International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) Conference**.

## The MusGO framework

MusGO is composed of **13 categories**: 8 _essential_ and 5 _desirable_. Essential categories follow an **openness-graded scale** of three levels: **closed** (üî¥), **partial** (üü†) and **fully open** (üü¢). Instead, desirable categories are binary, indicating whether the element exists (**‚≠ê**) or not. Framework criteria is detailed [here](https://roserbatlleroca.github.io/MusGO_framework/framework.html).

### Essential Categories
Open source code ‚Ä¢ Training data ‚Ä¢ Model weights ‚Ä¢ Code documentation ‚Ä¢  Training procedure ‚Ä¢ Evaluation procedure ‚Ä¢ Research paper ‚Ä¢ Licensing  

### Desirable Categories
Model card ‚Ä¢ Datasheet ‚Ä¢ Package ‚Ä¢ User-oriented application ‚Ä¢ Supplementary material page

## Contribute

To help expand or refine the MusGO leaderboard, you can contribute by: 

- **Adding a new model** to the leaderboard. 
- **Proposing updates or modifications** to the evaluation of exisiting models. 

To get started, head over to our [**How to contribute?** page](projects/README.md). It includes:

- Instructions for submitting models via pull request
- Guidelines for proposing changes or opening issues
- A checklist to support evidence-based assessments


 Your feedback helps us maintain fair and up-to-date openness assessments. Thank you for contributing to the improvement of MusGO!

## üí¨ Any doubts or thoughts? Help us improve!

We‚Äôd love to hear your feedback, questions, or suggestions for improving the MusGO framework and the evaluation process. We encourage you to open up issues to: 
- Flag a particular assessment in the current evaluations. 
- Suggest improvements to the evaluation framework. 
- Ask questions about how to interpret the categories. 

You can also contact us directly at [roser.batlle@upf.edu](mailto:roser.batlle@upf.edu) and [laura.ibanez@upf.edu](mailto:laura.ibanez@upf.edu). 

## Disclaimer: Future Developments üöß

The MusGO framework is a living resource, developed through community collaboration, currently focused on assessing openness in music-generative AI. However, we are actively exploring complementary perspectives and refinements to further expand its scope and adaptability. We aim to better reflect the diverse ways in which music-generative systems can be understood, accessed, and used responsibly. 

Updates will be shared once ready for community feedback.
